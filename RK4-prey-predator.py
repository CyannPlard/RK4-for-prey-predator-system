""" INTRODUCTION """

#Here is prey-predator system solved with the Runge-Kutta 4 method. This code may be use to solve another differential equations system. 
#All you have to do is to :
    #change the time parameters at the begininng of the RK4 function in the "Solver" part.
    #replace the F function by the one you want to solve has explained in the "Function" part.
    #insert the right initial conditions in the y0 table as explained in the "Plot" part.
    #change the plot display eventually
    
# The type of problem we solve here are n differential equations of m order like :
        # dy/dx=g(y,x) with g a function determining this differential equation of 1st order
        # obviously there are then n variables to calculate (in the example above n=1)

""" RUNGE-KUTTA 4 SOLVER """

#F is the function resuming the n differential equation(s) (defined in the "function" part)
#y0 is a list containing the m*n initial conditions of the problem (explained in the "plot" part).

              # y may contain the value at time t of each variable of each order involved in the equations, in the same order as in y0 (explained later)
# Return : #table containing the value of the functions determining the equation (like the value of g(x) in the example of the introduction)

""" Here an example of a second order equation (n=1, m=2)
We have the following equation:
d2y/dx2 = -y * dy/dx

We transform it in :
     dy/dx = z
     dz/dt = -yz

Then the corresponding F function in the program is :
    
def F(x,y):
    dy=y[1]
    dz=-y[0]*y[1]
    return np.array([dy,dz])
we can see that here the table y contain the variable y=[y(x),z(x)].

The initial values are :
y0[y(0), dy(0)/dx]
