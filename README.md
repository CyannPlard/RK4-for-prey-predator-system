A project during my studies was to program the prey-predator system with the Lotka-Voltera and Rosenzweig-McArthur models.

I used for that the Runge-Kutta 4 method of resolution.

The Lotka-Voltera system is an example of this method use, but this code may be adapted for any differential equation system (1 or 2 order, n equations of n variables). The modifications to make for this are explained in the code.

I hope this will be useful.
